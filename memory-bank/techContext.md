# Technical Context: Windows Development Environment

## Core Technologies

### Package Managers
- **Chocolatey/Scoop/Winget**: Windows equivalents to macOS's Homebrew for installing and managing software packages

### Version Control
- **Git**: Distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code
- **GitHub Desktop** (optional): GUI for Git operations

### Programming Languages & Runtimes
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side applications
- **Python**: General-purpose programming language with extensive libraries
- **VS Code**: Code editor with extensive plugin support

### Command Line Tools
- **Windows Terminal**: Modern terminal application for Windows
- **PowerShell**: Powerful command-line shell and scripting language

## Technical Constraints
- Windows-specific PATH configuration required
- Administrative permissions may be needed for some installations
- Some tools may require system restarts
- Environment variables must be correctly configured

## Dependencies
- Internet connection for downloading packages
- Sufficient disk space for installations
- Windows 10 or newer for best compatibility

## Development Process
1. Install package manager for centralized tool management
2. Configure Windows subsystems as needed
3. Install programming languages and runtimes
4. Set up environment variables and PATH configurations
5. Install additional development utilities
6. Verify all installations
