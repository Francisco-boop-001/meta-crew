# Active Context: Windows Development Environment Setup

## Current Focus
Completing the Windows development environment setup and providing comprehensive documentation.

## Recent Decisions
- Used Winget (already installed) as the package manager
- Added Windows Terminal and PowerToys to enhance the development experience
- Created comprehensive documentation for maintaining the environment
- Provided manual installation instructions for tools that had installation issues

## Technical Considerations
- Windows 10 is the target operating system (confirmed)
- PowerShell was used for installations and verification
- Most core tools were already properly configured with PATH variables
- Some tools require administrative privileges for installation

## Current Challenges
- Some installation errors occurred with Postman, GitHub Desktop, and Docker Desktop
- These tools will require manual installation outside of Winget
- Administrative privileges may be needed for some installations

## Next Steps
1. Manually install remaining tools if needed (instructions provided)
2. Configure Git identity and preferences (instructions provided)
3. Explore PowerToys features to enhance productivity
4. Keep the development environment updated using provided maintenance commands

## Documentation Needs
- Installation steps for each tool
- Verification procedures
- Troubleshooting guidance if issues arise
- How to maintain/update the environment
