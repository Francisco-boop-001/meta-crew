2. Developer wants to understand what each tool does and why it's necessary
3. Developer needs proper configuration of tools to work efficiently
4. Developer wants a streamlined process to avoid common setup pitfalls

## Experience Goals
- Clear understanding of each development tool's purpose

- Ability to add/update tools as needed
- Consistent command-line experience across tools
- Easy access to documentation for further reference

## Success Metrics
- All tools installed and verified working
- Path configuration correctly set up
- Ability to run commands from any directory
